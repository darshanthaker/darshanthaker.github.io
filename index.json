[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a Ph.D. student at University of Pennsylvania, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. René Vidal. My research interests broadly lie in developed principled algorithms to steer deep generative models at inference time. One particular area of interest in this domain is solving image restoration problems in computer vision using diffusion priors. In the past, I have focused on trustworthy ML and adversarial robustness, studying the problem of provably reverse engineering adversarial attacks from corrupted samples. I am also interested in developing methods to align large language models to ensure safe outputs. I was an AWS-AI ASSET Fellow at UPenn for the year of 2024.\nI previously completed my MS in Computer Science at Columbia University, where I was advised by Prof. John Wright, and my BS degree in CS and Math at UT Austin.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://darshanthaker.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. student at University of Pennsylvania, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. René Vidal.
